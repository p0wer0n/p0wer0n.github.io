Description: AppSync Unified for iOS 9 allows you to install unsigned applications on iOS 9. This version of AppSync Unified was originally made by AngelXWind and was pulled from he repo. I take no credit for her work, and only take credit for uploading this package. Please do not use this package for piracy. Only install/sideload apps that YOU OWN. Do NOT use this to steal other developer's hard work!
